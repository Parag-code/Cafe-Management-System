# Cafe-Management-System
## Project Overview

This **Cafe Management System** is a simple Python-based program designed to simulate the ordering process at a restaurant or cafe. Customers can view the menu, order items, and choose a payment method. The system keeps track of the total order amount and displays the final cost, including the payment method.

The application is designed to be user-friendly and allows customers to:
- Order items from the menu.
- Add multiple items to their order.
- Choose a payment method (Cash or Online).
- View the final order total.

## Features
- Display of available menu items along with their prices.
- Ability to add multiple items to the order.
- Validation of available menu items.
- User-friendly interaction (order more, cancel order).
- Final order total and payment method selection.
- Supports basic input validation (for payment method).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The program is written in Python.
- **Basic Terminal/Console Input**: The program runs via terminal or command-line interface (CLI).
